Repo for Advent of Code 2022 edition!
All answers were prepared in Python, unless stated otherwise :)

*  [Day 1](./day1/day1.py) -> Done!
Lmao, during day 1 I thought the question asked for the indices of the elves. I could've used a much simpler approach :)
*  [Day 2](./day2/day2.py) -> Done!
Well I cheated and basically created a lookup table for each possible outcome
*  [Day 3](./day3/day3.py) -> Done!
All the ASCII shit I was thought 11 years ago now made sense lol
*  [Day 4](./day4/day4.py) -> Done!
Easy peasy set logic question
*  [Day 5](./day5/day5.py) -> Done!
Initially I got the question wrong, so spent hours on a complete senseless solution. Then in 10 minutes solved the thing
*  [Day 6](./day6/day6.py) -> Done!
Easy frequency question, though at the beginning I thought that in second part this will turn into a O(n^n) computational timing solution but it did not
